# Experience

Last spring, I served as a Teaching Assistant for Computer Science 665, Artificial Intelligence, at San Francisco State University. This course was modeled after UC Berkeley's Artificial Intelligence course, and also covered machine learning basics. This was the first time the course had been offered to undergraduates, and I served as TA while concurrently enrolled in the course. 

I also helped lead SF Hacks, the largest collegiate hackathon in San Francisco. 

Last summer I served as a LiveOps Intern at EBSCO Information Services, a new, understaffed team responsible for site reliability and maintenance. 

The summer prior I interned at Twitch, on the Systems Engineering team. 

I have also served as a Network Manager for the Berkeley Student Cooperative. 

Although most of my experience would appear to be in IT/Systems, I would very much like to become more involved in the software engineering side of things, to build and create things rather than maintain them.
